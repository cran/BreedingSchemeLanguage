\usage{
doubledHaploid(sEnv = NULL, nProgeny = 100, popID = NULL, parms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sEnv}{the environment that BSL functions operate in. Default is "simEnv" so use that to avoid specifying when calling functions}

\item{nProgeny}{the number of progeny}

\item{popID}{population ID to be devided by meiosis and doubled (default: the latest population)}

\item{parms}{optional named list. Objects with those names will be created with the corresponding values. A way to pass values that are not predetermined by the script. Default: NULL}
}
\value{
modifies the list sims in environment sEnv by creating a doubled haploid progeny population as specified, with an incremented population number
